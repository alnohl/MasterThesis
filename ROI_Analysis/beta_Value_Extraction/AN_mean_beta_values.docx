## Extract mean beta values

For this code, you need MATLAB, the toolbox SPM12, as well as the toolbox xjView. Additionally, you need to have a mask for your ROI (or know the coordinates of your ROI to create a spherical mask)

1. Open Matlab
2. Write in the command window: myxjViewBrowser
3. Click on “load” on the top right corner of the appearing window
4. Select the second level data you want to analyze
5. Select one of the files in the most right column (doesn’t matter which)
6. Skip this step if you use a mask (and therefore don't need to create a spherical mask)! Put in the coordinates of your ROI in the new appearing window (lower left corner)
7. Go back to the other window
8. Select “showBetaAllCondVOI_2015” (in the field next to “load”)
9. Skip this step if you use a mask (and therefore don't need to create a spherical mask)!Select “Sphere” with coordinates of the ROI radius 6/8mm
10. Select “..” and then choose your mask

The results (beta-values) will now be copied in the Zwischenablage. Open a new excel file and paste the data.

WARNING: the data will not contain the information of the participants. The order of the participants will be the same as you read them in the script.

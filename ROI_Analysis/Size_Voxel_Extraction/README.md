### Size of activation

The two scripts "AN_extractVoxel_FFA_mac.m" and "AN_extractVoxel_VWFA_mac.m" are two independent scripts. Both require the file "AN_extractTImeCourse.m" when running the script.
- "AN_extractVoxel_FFA_mac.m" is to calculate the size of activation for the two face-processing contrasts (FacesVsBaseline and FacesVsWords)
- â€œAN_extractVoxel_VWFA_mac.m" is to calculate the size of activation for the two word-processing contrasts (WordsVsBaseline and WordsVsFaces)

Change the paths and (if necessary) the contrasts (e.g., spmT_0005.nii is for the contrast FacesVsBaseline)

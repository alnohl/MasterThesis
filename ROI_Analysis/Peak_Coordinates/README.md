### Peak Coordinates

These are two independent scripts.
- "AN_peak_coordinates_FFA.m" is to calculate the peak coordinates for the two face-processing contrasts (FacesVsBaseline and FacesVsWords)
- "AN_peak_coordinates_VWFA.m" is to calculate the peak coordinates for the two word-processing contrasts (WordsVsBaseline and WordsVsFaces)

Change the path to your mask and the file name (how you want to name the output file with the peak coordinates). If necessary, change the con_files (e.g., *con_0005 for WordsVsBaseline).

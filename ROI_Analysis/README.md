## Scripts for ROI Analysis

All scripts require MATLAB and the toolbox SPM12. For "beta_Value_Extraction", the toolbox xjView is also required.
- "Peak_Coordinates" containst of a script extracting the coordinates of the voxel with highest beta activity.
- "Size_Voxel_Extraction" results in the size of activation of the ROI (counting each voxel above a certain threshold).
- "beta_Value_Extraction" is a word document explaining the process to determine the mean beta values in a mask with xjView

### 2nd Level Analysis

These scripts are three independent scripts.
- "AN_2ndLevel_mac.m" creates the "regular" 2nd level analysis with all participants
- "AN_2ndLevel_regression_mac.m" creates a regression analysis between the brain activation (BOLD signal) and an additional value (age, reading ability, etc.)
- "AN_2ndLevel_t_test_mac.m" creates a t-test of the brain activation (BOLD signal) between two groups (e.g., typical readers and poor readers)

Change all paths, number of con files in line 31 the names of the con folders in lines 46-51 (the con folder names are usually the same as the contrast names).

<br/>

#### "AN_2ndLevel_regression_mac.m":
Change all paths, the number of con files in lines 34 and 46, and the names of the con folders in lines 65-70 (the con folder names are usually the same as the contrast names).

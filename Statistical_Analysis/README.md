## Scripts for Statistical Analysis

The scripts "AN_Bayes_Factor.R", "AN_correlation_coefficient.R", "AN_onewayANOVA.R" and "AN_t-test.R" are all codes for statistical analyses in R.

- "AN_Bayes_Factor.R" was only used after the script "AN_onewayANOVA.R" revealed no significant differences between the groups.
- "AN_correlation_coefficient.R" can be used for correlation analysis, calculating either the Pearson or Kendall correlation coefficient (depending if the data is distributed normally or not).
- "AN_t-test.R" can perform a t-test or a Wilcoxon test (also depending if the data is distributed normally or not).
